# VSCode plugin for Kite

KiteCode is a plugin that integrates Kite, the programming assistant into
Visual Studio code. Kite will automagically suggest library usages, point out
syntactic errors, and will generally work with you to make (Python)
development less painful.

### Installation

Download Kite from http://kite.com/. During the installation process, select
"Visual Studio Code" in the list of editors and Kite will install this plugin
for you.

### Manual Installation

```
npm install
make install   # will copy files into your ~/.vscode dir
```

Then start vscode and you should see Kite in the list of extensions.
