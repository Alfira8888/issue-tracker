Kite is an artificial pair programmer, which helps you code better and faster. To allow Kite to do so, we've made various editor plugins to connect your programming environment to our backend. What's even better is that we are making all the source code for the plugins public, and we invite you to make Kite alive for many more editors!

## Contributing
Kite currently supports vim, Sublime Text, PyCharm and Atom, and we expect the list to grow fast! To live the philosophy of bring-your-own editor, we made it extremely easy to write a Kite plugin for your editor. Check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kiteco/plugins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and give it a shot. We invite all hackers out there to bring Kite to their favorite editor!
