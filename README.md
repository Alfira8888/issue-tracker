Kite is an artificial pair programmer, which helps you code better and faster. To allow Kite to do so, we've made various editor plug-ins to connect your programming environment to a massive knowldge base out there. What's even better is that we are making all the source code for the plug-ins public, and we invite you to make Kite alive for many more editors!

## Contributing
Kite currently supports vim, Sublime Text, PyCharm and Atom, and we expect the list to grow fast! To live the philosophy of bring-your-own editor, we made it extremely easy to write a Kite plug-in for your editor. Check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kiteco/plugins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING) and give it a shot. We invite all hackers out there to bring Kite to their favorite editor!
